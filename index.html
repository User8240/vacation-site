            If I could travel anywhere, I'd absolutely want to go to Korea! 
            I'm a big fan of Korean food, and have always wanted a spa-getaway
            vacation. Korea would be the most optimal place to do that!

            They've got some of the best skin care, amongst other things relating
            to cosmetics. Not to mention, it's very common there to go get facials
            and massages and such so it's much more affordable!

            If I could go there and take care of my skin and body, while also eating
            some of my favorite foods, that would hands down be the best vacation 
            ever!

            <p class="text-info">"We were pleasantly surprised by the natural beauty of South Corea. The country was basically not on our bucket list, but we had wanted to go to Wladiwostok by Transsiberian Railway and then on to Donghae by ferry. Communication was often difficult because we met very few people who spoke English, not even the receptionists at the hotels. But with the help of Google Translate and sign language, it worked. People were very helpful."</p>
